# Contactless Menu App for Restaurants
- **Why:** With the ongoing emphasis on hygiene and social distancing, restaurants are adopting contactless solutions. This app allows diners to view menus, place orders, and pay bills using their smartphones, reducing physical contact and enhancing the dining experience.

### Technologies
- **Frontend**
  - **Mobile Development Framework**: Develop native apps for iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) or use cross-platform frameworks like React Native for a single codebase.
  - **Web Technologies**: Build a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for customers who prefer not to download an app.
- **Backend**
  - **Programming Language**: Choose a language like Python with Django or Node.js with Express.js for server-side functionality.
  - **Database**: Use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase to store menu items, images, and restaurant information.
- **Deployment**
  - **Cloud Platform**: Utilize cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability and easy maintenance.

### App Logic Overview
1. **Restaurant Setup**:
   - Restaurants create accounts and manage their menus through a web interface.
   - The interface allows uploading menu items, descriptions, prices, and images.
2. **Customer Experience**:
   - Customers arrive at the restaurant and scan a QR code displayed on the table or signage.
   - The QR code directs them to the restaurant's contactless menu on their mobile browser or opens the app (if downloaded).
   - The menu displays high-quality images, descriptions, and allergen information _(optional)_.
   - Customers can browse the menu, customize their orders with modifiers (if applicable), and add items to a virtual cart.
3. **Ordering** _(Two Options)_:
   - Direct Order: Customers submit their orders directly through the app, and it transmits the order to the restaurant's kitchen management system (if integrated) or a designated staff member.
   - Staff Assisted: Customers browse and potentially pre-select items but finalize the order by flagging down a staff member who confirms and submits it electronically.
4. **Payment** _(Optional)_:
   - Integrate a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for in-app payments if desired.
5. **Additional Features** _(Optional)_:
   - Allow online reservations.
   - Implement a loyalty program for repeat customers.
   - Offer customer reviews and ratings.


### App Logic Overview 2 (SDE-I)
- User Authentication and Registration:
  - Users (customers) should be able to register and log in to the app securely.
  - Authentication can be implemented using email/password, social media login (e.g., Google, Facebook), or mobile phone verification.
- Restaurant Profile Setup:
  - Restaurants need to register and set up their profiles, including basic information such as name, location, contact details, and menu items.
  - They can also upload images of their menu items for visual appeal.

  - Restaurants should be able to manage their menus dynamically.
  - They can add, edit, or delete menu items, along with their descriptions, prices, and categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
- QR Code Generation:
  - Each restaurant should have a unique QR code associated with its menu.
  - When a customer scans the QR code using their smartphone camera through the app, it should directly lead them to the restaurant's menu page.
- Contactless Menu Viewing:
  - Customers can browse the restaurant's menu items through the app without physical menus.
  - They can view item details, including descriptions, prices, and images, enhancing their dining experience.

  - They can manage orders, update order status (e.g., preparing, ready for pickup), and mark orders as completed.

  - Integration with payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, or in-app wallets can facilitate seamless transactions.
- Feedback and Reviews:
